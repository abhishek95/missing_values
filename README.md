# missing_values
Homework 2 - Dealing with missing values in a dataset

Datset(2 files)
-Wholesale customers data-missing.csv
-Wholesale customers data.csv

Python code using Bokeh library

-> Missing values are tackled in three way
1. Ignoring missing values and apply analytics(regression)
2. Computing Median across attributes
3. Averaging values across attributes

Set mode=0/1/2 depending on approach
Code is commented and should be readable

Each figure contains 4 plots:
1. Regression line on orginal dataset (visualising original dataset)
2. Scatter plot on original and missing value dataset
3. Predicted missing values, can be compared to regression line as well. (may give warnings because of supplying user defined values, ignore them!)
4. Original values corresponding to missing values are highlighted as well.
